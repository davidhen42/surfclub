Starting the web server
You need to be in the directory that contains the manage.py file (the djangogirls directory). In the console, we can start the web server by running python manage.py runserver:

(myvenv) ~/djangogirls$ python manage.py runserver


Creating an application
To keep everything tidy, we will create a separate application inside our project. It is very nice to have everything organized from the very beginning. To create an application we need to run the following command in the console (from djangogirls directory where manage.py file is):

Mac OS X and Linux:
(myvenv) ~/djangogirls$ python manage.py startapp blog




Create tables for models in your database
The last step here is to add our new model to our database. First we have to make Django know that we have some changes in our model. (We have just created it!) Go to your console window and type python manage.py makemigrations blog. It will look like this:

command-line
(myvenv) ~/djangogirls$ python manage.py makemigrations blog
Migrations for 'blog':
  blog/migrations/0001_initial.py:
  - Create model Post


Django prepared a migration file for us that we now have to apply to our database. Type python manage.py migrate blog and the output should be as follows:

command-line
(myvenv) ~/djangogirls$ python manage.py migrate blog
Operations to perform:
  Apply all migrations: blog
Running migrations:
  Applying blog.0001_initial... OK
